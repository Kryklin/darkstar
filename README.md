`darkstar` is a powerful, client-side security tool designed to safeguard your Bitcoin wallet's recovery phrase (BIP39 mnemonic). It provides a robust, multi-layered solution for obfuscating and encrypting your seed phrase, adding a critical layer of security to protect your digital assets from both physical and digital threats. Available as both a web application and a cross-platform desktop application built with Electron.

## Features

- **AES-256 Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption to protect your data.
- **Multi-Layered Obfuscation**: A sophisticated, multi-stage process to secure your recovery phrase.
- **Cross-Platform Desktop App**: Available as a desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux, built with Electron.
  - **Frameless Window**: A modern, clean look without the default window frame.
  - **Custom Window Controls**: Custom-built window controls for minimizing, maximizing, and closing the application.
  - **Draggable Area**: The top navigation bar acts as a draggable area.
- **Client-Side Security**: All operations are performed client-side, ensuring your data never leaves your machine.
- **Light & Dark Theme**: A user-friendly interface with both light and dark themes.

## Commands

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kryklin/darkstar.git
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd darkstar
    npm install
    ```

### Development

To start the application in development mode with hot-reloading for both web and desktop:
```bash
npm start
```

### Building

To create a distributable package for your current operating system:
```bash
npm run make
```
The packaged application will be located in the `out` folder.

### Testing

To run the unit tests using Karma and Jasmine:
```bash
npm test
```
This command opens a new browser window and runs all the `.spec.ts` files. The results are displayed in the terminal.

## How it Works

`darkstar` employs a sophisticated, multi-stage process to secure your recovery phrase:

1.  **Function Selection & Shuffling**: For each word in the mnemonic, Darkstar takes a curated pool of 12 obfuscation functions (6 seeded, 6 unseeded). It deterministically shuffles the order of these 12 functions based on the password and the word itself, creating a unique, unpredictable chain of operations for every word.
2.  **Password and Reverse Key Seeding**: The security model requires both the password and the reverse key for decryption. All 6 seeded functions (e.g., Vigen√®re Cipher, Character Shuffling) use a combined seed derived from both the password and a checksum of the shuffled function sequence. This ensures that the reverse key is not just a map, but an integral part of the decryption seed.
3.  **Multi-Layered Obfuscation**: The word is passed through the entire shuffled chain of 12 functions, applying complex, layered transformations.
4.  **AES-256 Encryption**: The final, heavily obfuscated words are joined together and then encrypted using the industry-standard AES-256 algorithm with the user-provided password.
5.  **Reverse Key Generation**: A "reverse key" is generated, containing the precise (and uniquely shuffled) sequence of obfuscation functions used for each word.
6.  **Key Encoding**: This reverse key is then Base64 encoded.

To decrypt, you need both the **Base64 encoded reverse key** (to reconstruct the shuffled function order and contribute to the seed) and your **password** (to decrypt the data and contribute to the seed). This dual-component, deeply integrated system provides a robust defense against attempts to compromise the recovery phrase.
