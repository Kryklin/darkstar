        A client-side security tool designed to safeguard your Bitcoin wallet's recovery phrase (BIP39 mnemonic). It provides a robust, multi-layered solution for obfuscating and encrypting your seed phrase, adding a critical layer of security to protect your digital assets from both physical and digital threats.
      </p>
      
      <h3>How it Works</h3>
      <p>Darkstar employs a sophisticated, multi-stage process to secure your recovery phrase:</p>
      <mat-list role="list">
        <mat-list-item role="listitem">
          <strong>1. Guaranteed Seeded Obfuscation:</strong> For each word, Darkstar randomly selects 12 unique obfuscation functions from a pool of 24. Crucially, it guarantees that at least one of these is a "seeded" function (e.g., character shuffling) that uses your password, deeply integrating the password into the obfuscation itself.
        </mat-list-item>
        <mat-list-item role="listitem">
          <strong>2. AES-256 Encryption:</strong> The collection of obfuscated words is joined together and then encrypted using the industry-standard AES-256 algorithm with a user-provided password.
        </mat-list-item>
        <mat-list-item role="listitem">
          <strong>3. Reverse Key Generation:</strong> A "reverse key" is generated, containing the precise sequence of obfuscation functions used for each word.
        </mat-list-item>
        <mat-list-item role="listitem">
          <strong>4. Key Encoding:</strong> This reverse key is then Base64 encoded. This is the final key you need to store.
        </mat-list-item>
      </mat-list>
      <p>To decrypt, you need both the <strong>Base64 encoded reverse key</strong> (to reverse the obfuscation) and your <strong>password</strong> (to decrypt the data). This dual-component system significantly enhances the security of your recovery phrase.</p>
