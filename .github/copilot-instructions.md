# Copilot Instructions

This document provides instructions for AI coding agents to effectively contribute to the `darkstar` project.

## Architecture

This is a standard Angular project generated with Angular CLI.

- The main application entry point is `src/main.ts`.
- The root application component is `src/app/app.ts`, with its template in `src/app/app.html` and styles in `src/app/app.scss`.
- Application routes are defined in `src/app/app.routes.ts`.
- Global styles are located in `src/styles.scss`.

## Developer Workflows

### Running the application

To start the local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This is an alias for `ng serve`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/` and will automatically reload on file changes.

### Running tests

To execute the unit tests via Karma, run:

```bash
npm test
```

### Building the project

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Code Conventions

- This project uses Prettier for code formatting. The configuration is defined in the `prettier` key in `package.json`.
- Follow the official [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.dev/style-guide) and [Best Practices](https://angular.dev/best-practices) for all contributions.
- New components, services, etc., should be generated using the Angular CLI to maintain consistency. For example: `ng generate component my-new-component`.

## Key Angular Concepts

- **Components:** The fundamental building blocks of Angular applications. Each component consists of a TypeScript class, an HTML template, and styles.
- **Templates:** Define the view of a component, combining HTML with Angular template syntax to display dynamic data.
- **Directives:** Add behavior to HTML elements. Structural directives shape the DOM layout (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`), while attribute directives change the appearance or behavior of an element.
- **Signals:** A system for managing state changes within the application. Signals provide a reactive way to link your data to the UI, automatically updating the view when the data changes.
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** A design pattern in which a class requests dependencies from external sources rather than creating them. Angular's DI framework is used to provide services to components.
- **Routing:** The Angular Router enables navigation between different views in a single-page application without a full page reload.
- **Forms:** Angular provides two main approaches for handling user input: template-driven forms and reactive forms.
- **HTTP Client:** A built-in service for making HTTP requests to external APIs.
- **Angular Material:** This project uses Angular Material for its UI components. It provides a suite of high-quality, pre-built components that follow Material Design principles.

## TypeScript

This project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. All code should be written in TypeScript, following best practices for static typing.

### Key Concepts

- **Static Types:** Use static types for variables, function parameters, and return values to catch errors early and improve code readability.
- **Interfaces:** Define custom types for complex objects to ensure type safety.
- **Generics:** Use generics to create reusable components that can work with a variety of types.
- **Modules:** Organize code into modules to maintain a clean and scalable project structure.
